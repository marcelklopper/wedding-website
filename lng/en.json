  "howhow":"Swipe left, swipe right, swipe left‚Ä¶.Ping! ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been Super Liked‚Äù. And that‚Äôs where it all started. Carelize wasn‚Äôt very impressed with Marcel‚Äôs ‚Äòbergie‚Äô-like beard, but she had a sneaky suspicion that there was a good looking guy lurking behind. She thought ‚ÄúAg shame, let‚Äôs give this guy a chance‚Äù. On their first date, Marcel‚Äôs eyes were so red that Carelize thought he smoked a very specific type of leaf. Turns out the poor guy just came from a long day at work, and even though he was beyond tired, he didn‚Äôt want to miss out on a date with this very attractive blonde girl. There was an instant attraction. They spent the whole evening talking and getting to know one another. Afterwards, Marcel asked if he could come in for ‚Äòa cup of tea‚Äô üòâ but Carelize politely declined. Marcel knew there and then, that she‚Äôs a keeper.  Carelize wasn‚Äôt even inside her apartment when she got a message asking ‚ÄúSo when will I see you again?‚Äù¬†and, as they say, the rest is history.",
